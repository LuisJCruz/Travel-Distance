Java program to optimize train routes and calculate passenger travel times. Leveraging advanced data structures like Maps, Stacks, and Sets, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from Westside to every other station, ensuring efficiency in route planning. Additionally, I integrated functionality to parse input data from a CSV file, organize station connections, and optimize stack sorting algorithms
